# IBC integration

[IBC](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15918.pdf) allows a ledger to track another ledger's consensus state using a light client. IBC is a protocol to agree the consensus state and to send/receive packets between ledgers.

## Transaction for IBC
A requester (IBC relayer or user) who wants to execute IBC operations on a ledger sets IBC packet or message like `MsgCreateAnyClient` as transaction data and submit the following transaction. IBC validity predicate is invoked after this transaction execution to check the IBC operation is validated. The trigger to invoke IBC validity predicate is changing IBC-related keys (e.g. prefixed with `ibc/`).

The transaction is given an IBC packet or message which specifies what to do. Because the packet or message has been encoded and stored in transaction data and there are some types of messages, it has to check what packet or message is given first and then decodes the message or packet. Then, it can modify the ledger state by writing not only data specified in the transaction but also IBC-related data on the storage sub-space. After the process according to the packet or message, it emits an IBC event.

- Transaction given a message
  ```rust
  #[transaction]
  fn apply_tx(tx_data: Vec<u8>) {
      let signed =
          key::ed25519::SignedTxData::try_from_slice(&tx_data[..]).unwrap();
      let messages: Vec<Any> = prost::Message::decode(&signed.data[..]).unwrap();
      let result = match message.type_url.as_str() {
          // decode each message: refer to `ibc-rs`
          create_client::TYPE_URL => {
              let domain_msg = create_client::MsgCreateAnyClient::decode_vec(&any_msg.value)
                  .map_err(|e| Kind::MalformedMessageBytes.context(e))?;
              create_client(domain_msg.client_state, &domain_msg.consensus_state)
          }
          // other messages
          ...
      };
      match &result {
          Ok(output) => emit_event(output.events),
          Err(e) => {
              tx::log_string(format!("IBC operation faild {}", e));
              unreachable!()
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- Transaction given a packet
  ```rust
  #[transaction]
  fn apply_tx(tx_data: Vec<u8>) {
      let signed =
          key::ed25519::SignedTxData::try_from_slice(&tx_data[..]).unwrap();
      let packet: Packet = prost::Message::decode(&signed.data[..]).unwrap();
      let data: FungibleTokenPacketData = prost::Message::decode(&packet.data[..]).unwrap();
      let result = ibc_transfer(data);
      match &result {
          Ok(output) => emit_event(output.events),
          Err(e) => {
              tx::log_string(format!("IBC transfer faild {}", e));
              unreachable!()
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### Make a packet
IBC-related transaction for some messages or packets makes a packet. For example, when a transaction wants to transfer a token between ledgers, it should make a packet including `FungibleTokenPacketData` to specify the sender, receiver, token, and amount.

### Store IBC-related data
The IBC-related transaction can write IBC-related data to check the state or to be proved by other ledgers according to IBC protocol. Its storage key should be prefixed with `InternalAddress::Ibc` and a specific character `^` to protect them from other storage operations. The paths(keys) for Tendermint client are defined by [ICS 24](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/master/spec/core/ics-024-host-requirements/README.md#path-space). For example, a client state will be stored with a key `#IBC/^/clients/{client_id}/clientState`.

### Emit IBC event
The ledger should set an IBC event to `events` in the ABCI response to allow relayers to get the events. The transaction execution should return `TxResult` including an event. IBC relayer can subscribe the ledger with Tendermint RPC and get the event.

### Handle IBC modules
IBC-related transactions should call functions to handle IBC modules. These functions are defined in [ibc-rs](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs) in traits (e.g. [`ClientReader`](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/blob/d41e7253b997024e9f5852735450e1049176ed3a/modules/src/ics02_client/context.rs#L14)). But we can implement IBC-related operations (e.g. `create_client()`) without these traits because Anoma WASM transaction accesses the storage through the host environment functions.

```rust
/* shared/src/types/storage.rs */

impl Key {
    ...

    /// Check if the given key is a key to IBC-related data
    pub fn is_ibc_key() -> bool {
        // check if the key has the reserved prefix
    }

    /// Returns a key of the IBC-related data
    /// Only this function can push the reserved prefix
    pub fn ibc_key(path: impl AsRef<str>) -> Result<Self> {
        // make a Key for IBC-related data with the reserved prefix
    }
}
```

```rust
/* vm_env/src/ibc.rs */

pub fn create_client(client_state: &ClientState, consensus_state: &AnyConsensusState) -> HandlerResult<ClientResult> {
    use crate::imports::tx;

    ...
    let key = Key::ibc_key(client_counter_key);
    let id_counter = tx::read(key).unwrap_or_default();
    let client_id = ClientId::new(client_state.client_type(), id_counter).expect("cannot get an IBC client ID");
    tx::write(key, id_counter + 1);

    let key = Key::ibc_key(client_type_key);
    tx::write(key, client_state.client_type());
    let key = Key::ibc_key(client_state_key);
    tx::write(key, client_state);
    let key = Key::ibc_key(consensus_state_key);
    tx::write(key, consensus_state);

    // make a result
    ...
}
```

## IBC validity predicate
IBC validity predicate validates that the IBC-related transactions are correct by checking the ledger state including prior and posterior. It is executed after a transaction has written IBC-related state. If the result is true, the IBC-related mutations are committed and the events are returned. If the result is false, the IBC-related mustations are dropped and the events aren't emitted. For the performance, IBC validity predicate is a [native validity predicate](ledger/vp.md#native-vps) that are built into the ledger.

IBC validity predicate has to execute the following validations for state changes of IBC modules.

```rust
/* shared/src/ledger/ibc.rs */

pub struct Ibc<'a, DB, H>
where
    DB: storage::DB + for<'iter> storage::DBIter<'iter>,
    H: StorageHasher,
{
    /// Context to interact with the host structures.
    pub ctx: Ctx<'a, DB, H>,
}

impl NativeVp for Ibc {
    const ADDR: InternalAddress = InternalAddress::Ibc;

    fn init_genesis_storage<DB, H>(storage: &mut Storage<DB, H>)
    where
        DB: storage::DB + for<'iter> storage::DBIter<'iter>,
        H: StorageHasher
    {
        // initialize the counters of client, connection and channel module
    }

    ) -> Result<bool> {
        for key in keys_changed {
            if !key.is_ibc_key() {
                continue;
            }

### Handle IBC modules
Like IBC-related transactions, the validity predicate should handle IBC modules. It only reads the prior or the posterior state to validate them. `Keeper` to write IBC-related data aren't required, but we needs to implement `Reader` for both the prior and the posterior state. To use verification functions in `ibc-rs`, implementations for traits for IBC modules (e.g. `ClientReader`) should be for the posterior state. For example, we can call [`verify_proofs()`](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/blob/d41e7253b997024e9f5852735450e1049176ed3a/modules/src/ics03_connection/handler/verify.rs#L14) with the IBC's context in a step of the connection handshake: `verify_proofs(ibc, client_state, &conn_end, &expected_conn, proofs)`.

```rust
/* shared/src/ledger/ibc.rs */

pub struct Ibc<'a, DB, H>
where
    DB: storage::DB + for<'iter> storage::DBIter<'iter>,
    H: StorageHasher,
{
    /// Context to interact with the host structures.
    pub ctx: Ctx<'a, DB, H>,
}

// Add implementations to get the posterior state for validations in `ibc-rs`
// ICS 2
impl<'a, DB, H> ClientReader for Ibc<'a, DB, H> {...}
// ICS 3
impl<'a, DB, H> ConnectionReader for Ibc<'a, DB, H> {...}
// ICS 4
impl<'a, DB, H> ChannelReader for Ibc<'a, DB, H> {...}
// ICS 5
impl<'a, DB, H> PortReader for Ibc<'a, DB, H> {...}

impl<'a, DB, H> Ibc<'a, DB, H>
where
    DB: 'static + storage::DB + for<'iter> storage::DBIter<'iter>,
    H: 'static + StorageHasher,
{
    ...

    // Add functions to get the prior state if needed
    pub fn client_type_pre(&self, client_id: &ClientId) -> Result<Option<ClientType>> {
        ...
    }
    pub fn client_state_pre(&self, client_id: &ClientId) -> Result<Option<AnyClientState>> {
        ...
    }
    pub fn consensus_state_pre(&self, client_id: &ClientId, height: Height) -> Result<Option<AnyConsensusState>> {
        ...
    }
    pub fn client_counter_pre(&self) -> Result<u64> {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

## Relayer (ICS 18)
IBC relayer monitors the ledger, gets the status, state and proofs on the ledger, and requests transactions to the ledger via Tendermint RPC according to IBC protocol. For relayers, the ledger has to make a packet, emits an IBC event and stores proofs if needed. And, a relayer has to support Anoma ledger to query and validate the ledger state. It means that `Chain` in IBC Relayer of [ibc-rs](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs) should be implemented for Anoma like [that of CosmosSDK](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs/blob/master/relayer/src/chain/cosmos.rs).

```rust
impl Chain for Anoma {
    ...
}
```
