# Troubleshooting

This document addresses common issues users on Namada have faced, and what to do to resolve them.

## Installing Namada from source


### Not enough RAM
[Building binaries locally](../user-guide/install/from-source.md) is a computationally heavy task and will put your computer to the test. The compilation usually requires at least 16 GB of RAM and depending on the optimisation of your machine, could require slightly more (for some machines slightly less). For this reason, compilation can sometimes fail and will require.

The error `src/apps/namada lib could not compile due to previous errors. Exited with exit code: ` is a common error that can sometimes mean your computer ran out of memory when compiling. To resolve this, I have found closing all other applications and recompiling once or twice will do the trick. Otherwise more RAM will be needed.

### Compiling for the first time
Compilation errors due to missing library installations when building the binaries for the first time can be a common problem. 


#### Linker "CC" not found
If one runs into the error

```
 Entering directory '/root/namada/wasm/wasm_source'
RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s'  cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --target-dir 'target' --features tx_bond && \
cp "./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/namada_wasm.wasm" ../tx_bond.wasm
   Compiling proc-macro2 v1.0.46
   Compiling quote v1.0.21
error: linker `cc` not found
  |
  = note: No such file or directory (os error 2)

error: could not compile `quote` due to previous error
warning: build failed, waiting for other jobs to finish...
error: could not compile `proc-macro2` due to previous error
```

It may be resolved by running

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential
```


#### WASM32-unknown-unknown
Another issue the compiler may run into is that it cannot find the wasm32-unknown-unknown target.

```bash
error[E0463]: can't find crate for `core`
  |
  = note: the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target may not be installed
  = help: consider downloading the target with `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`

error[E0463]: can't find crate for `compiler_builtins`

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0463`.
error: could not compile `cfg-if` due to 2 previous errors
```

This issue can be resolved by running 

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```
(Yes the name of the target is `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. This is not the compiler unable to tell which version/release it is).

## Validator Troubleshooting

### Missed pre-genesis

If you missed setting up as a validator pre-genesis, this means you must set up to become one post-genesis. It is not possible to add pre-genesis validators once the chain has been launched (as by definition). Instead, any full-node can become a validator through self-bonding NAM tokens.

### Tendermint

When facing tendermint issues as a validator, the most common cause of the issue is that we are running the wrong version of tendermint. Keep an eye on the testnet docs [here](./README.md)


```admonish note
Note that the common debug statement `Error reconnecting to peers` does not mean that your node is not working properly. Instead, it means there *exists at least one* validator on the network not working properly. To check whether this is a problem on your end, note the block height and see if it corresponds to the blockheight at [https://namada.world](https://namada.world)
